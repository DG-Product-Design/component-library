## PURPOSE OF PROJECT
The purpose of this component library is to:
* Improve the developer experience by eliminating need to write CSS, with some exceptions
* Increase developer momentum by growing the library over time
* Maintain brand and style consistency across all digital products

## RUNNING THE APP
This app does not run like most React apps. Instead, this application exports its components and displays documentation via Storybook.

To view the documentation, navigate to the app's root directory (ex: `~username/repos/componentLibrary/`) and run:
- `npx storybook init`
- Then: `npm run storybook`
